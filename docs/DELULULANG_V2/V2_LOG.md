# V2 log

The running log (owner, 2026-09-18, D-V2-22): one short block per phase, newest last. Details live
in the commits and in project storage (`D:\nelan\DeluluLang-agent-transcripts\<date>-<phase>\`).
Phase state: [`V2_PHASE_STATUS.md`](V2_PHASE_STATUS.md). Decisions: [`V2_DECISION_LOG.md`](V2_DECISION_LOG.md).
The long logs, [`V2_EXECUTION_LOG.md`](V2_EXECUTION_LOG.md) and [`V2_AGENT_LOG.md`](V2_AGENT_LOG.md),
are frozen at P1.

## V2-0 — 2026-09-17 — complete
- Commit `e48f9c3` (CI `35258166713` green), record `94c6e29` (CI `35259510471` green).
- 32 historical documents moved to `docs/archive/v1/`; the V2 folder; the Survey's archive-mirror rule.

## P1 machine-contract truth — 2026-09-18 — complete
- Commit `d8dbc24` (CI `35299533343` green on 3 OSes), record `a93cfd8`. Opus 5 sous-chef; head chef verified.
- One JSON envelope on every reachable success; 145 → 1 diagnostics; `authority --grants`; editless
  repairs need a human; `test --json` diagnostics; bare `delulu test`; guide paths; accounting gate.
- Suite 1,674/0 on 126 binaries; snapshot 58 cases, all attributable. Rulings D-V2-19 to D-V2-21.
- Left open: P1-F1 to P1-F4 (roadmap, P1), 6.13, P1-11 (D-V2-17).

## P1-F closing P1 — 2026-09-18 — complete (CI recorded in the next block)
- F1 DL0404 cascade gone by poison propagation (generic `apply[F]` still DL0404); F2 `grants`/`guard`
  `--json` successes enveloped, broker-backed sweep; F3 undocumented shared flags refused by every
  command, allowlist read from the usage text `--help` prints; F4 `test <package-dir>` tests the whole
  package; F5 (RW 6.13 closed) fs trace records carry `resolved_path`/`scope_root`; F6 (D-NE-17, owner)
  `test --test-authority <row>`, narrows a package ceiling only, and every route to a test file meets its nearest enclosing package's ceiling.
- Snapshot: 12 cases, only DL0404 counts fell (greeter + 5 tier4-multimodule loose checks); blessed.
- Every task witnessed on `delulu-pre-p1f.exe` and falsified; evidence in agent storage `2026-09-18-p1f/`.
- P1-11 not built (owner ruling, D-V2-23).
- Head chef: found that F6 could be widened by reaching a package's test file by its path from outside; fixed
  and re-witnessed on 4 routes, both ways; snapshot re-checked structurally (12 cases, only DL0404 fell).
- CI `35347357572` red on Windows only: a pre-existing temp-dir race in `for_loop_cli.rs` (clock-only tags);
  fixed with a counter, pinned by a 16-thread test that fails without it.
- CI `35348430717` on `70864a2`: green on every job. P1 and P1-F complete.

## PS-0 sandbox truth — 2026-09-18 — complete
- 01 honest docs (no network client; `process` = foreign code only; RW 4.12–4.16); 02 `run --report-out`
  (D-V2-21), refused in `fs.write` scopes with `--trace-out`, no final-symlink follow; 03 DL1408 repair;
  04 `sandbox probe` (attempts only); 05 `doctor` sandbox section; 06 Windows hostile path spellings
  refused (DL0904) + NUL; 07 worker read deadline (DL1409); 08 three CI experiments written, not run;
  09 `net.special=` (D-NE-28).
- Every task witnessed on `delulu-pre-ps0.exe` and falsified; snapshot unchanged; Linux build and
  clippy checked in WSL. Open: a DL code for 09, POSIX name normalization, the 60 s deadline.
- Handoff (owner moved to another account, 2026-09-18): the next steps, the head chef's leanings on the
  sous-chef's questions a–e and a patch backup are in `D:\nelan\DeluluLang-agent-transcripts\2026-09-18-ps0\RESUME-PS0.md`.
- Head chef verified 02/04/06/09 on the binary against the pre-PS-0 one (the pre binary WROTE a `CON` file and
  accepted every special address; 26 extra address spellings refused, public ones allowed). Found and fixed:
  a bare `--report-out rep.json` was refused as unresolvable (empty parent), with a falsified test; an
  unresolvable write scope now refuses instead of being skipped. Questions a–e: D-V2-24.
- Commit `32ba712`, CI `35376528795` green on every job (the macOS Seatbelt code's first compile).
- PS-0-08 experiments, run `35376590803`: Linux KVM needs a permission step, then a VMM boots to `/init`
  (L2 is testable on GitHub). Seatbelt blocks reads and writes; its network result is void (the probe's own
  baseline timed out). Windows restricted-token child works; the job's one-process limit did not stop a
  grandchild (limit or probe: RW 4.18, settled at PS-A's start).
- RW 4.18 closed: both were probe flaws (`if errorlevel 9` means 9 or higher; the baseline was not ready). Fixed
  in `85501ec`; run `35378619727`: the job blocks the grandchild (1816) and Seatbelt denies the network. Every
  L1 building block PS-A needs works on GitHub's Linux, macOS and Windows runners.
