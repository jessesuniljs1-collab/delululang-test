# V2 log

The running log (owner, 2026-09-18, D-V2-22): one short block per phase, newest last. Details live
in the commits and in project storage (`D:\nelan\DeluluLang-agent-transcripts\<date>-<phase>\`).
Phase state: [`V2_PHASE_STATUS.md`](V2_PHASE_STATUS.md). Decisions: [`V2_DECISION_LOG.md`](V2_DECISION_LOG.md).
The long logs, [`V2_EXECUTION_LOG.md`](V2_EXECUTION_LOG.md) and [`V2_AGENT_LOG.md`](V2_AGENT_LOG.md),
are frozen at P1.

## V2-0 — 2026-09-17 — complete
- Commit `e48f9c3` (CI `35258166713` green), record `94c6e29` (CI `35259510471` green).
- 32 historical documents moved to `docs/archive/v1/`; the V2 folder; the Survey's archive-mirror rule.

## P1 machine-contract truth — 2026-09-18 — complete
- Commit `d8dbc24` (CI `35299533343` green on 3 OSes), record `a93cfd8`. Opus 5 sous-chef; head chef verified.
- One JSON envelope on every reachable success; 145 → 1 diagnostics; `authority --grants`; editless
  repairs need a human; `test --json` diagnostics; bare `delulu test`; guide paths; accounting gate.
- Suite 1,674/0 on 126 binaries; snapshot 58 cases, all attributable. Rulings D-V2-19 to D-V2-21.
- Left open: P1-F1 to P1-F4 (roadmap, P1), 6.13, P1-11 (D-V2-17).

## P1-F closing P1 — 2026-09-18 — complete (CI recorded in the next block)
- F1 DL0404 cascade gone by poison propagation (generic `apply[F]` still DL0404); F2 `grants`/`guard`
  `--json` successes enveloped, broker-backed sweep; F3 undocumented shared flags refused by every
  command, allowlist read from the usage text `--help` prints; F4 `test <package-dir>` tests the whole
  package; F5 (RW 6.13 closed) fs trace records carry `resolved_path`/`scope_root`; F6 (D-NE-17, owner)
  `test --test-authority <row>`, narrows a package ceiling only, and every route to a test file meets its nearest enclosing package's ceiling.
- Snapshot: 12 cases, only DL0404 counts fell (greeter + 5 tier4-multimodule loose checks); blessed.
- Every task witnessed on `delulu-pre-p1f.exe` and falsified; evidence in agent storage `2026-09-18-p1f/`.
- P1-11 not built (owner ruling, D-V2-23).
- Head chef: found that F6 could be widened by reaching a package's test file by its path from outside; fixed
  and re-witnessed on 4 routes, both ways; snapshot re-checked structurally (12 cases, only DL0404 fell).
